    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti is one of those meals almost everybody eats, but no two people make it exactly the same. From 
    traditional Italian sauces made from fresh-picked tomatoes slowly simmered for two days, 
    to Southern sauces made with a pinch of white sugar that can be whipped up in 30 minutes, spaghetti recipes are as diverse as the folks who make them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Next time you set out to make your spaghetti recipe, this simple trick will help 
    you create fewer dirty dishes and less mess â€” which means more time spent gathered around the table with the people you love.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>pasta</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>lean beef</li>
        <li>cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>herbs and spices</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, brown one pound of ground beef on medium-high heat until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Drain and discard any excess grease, and add the beef back to your pot. (Be sure you don't ever pour grease down the drain. Do this instead.)</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to medium-low, and add 1 jar of store-bought marinara, 1 cup of chicken or beef broth, 1 bunch of chopped fresh basil, 1 clove of finely chopped garlic, a pinch of salt and pepper, and a few sprinkles of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on medium-low for 15 minutes, stirring once to keep it from sticking.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes of cooking, add 3 more cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of water (or cream if you like a creamy sauce) to your sauce, and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add 1 pound of thin spaghetti, and raise the heat to medium-high. Break your spaghetti noodles in half if you need to so they all get submerged in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Bring it to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low or medium-low for 15 minutes, stirring once to make sure it doesn't stick.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, check that your noodles are done, and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container in the fridge for two to three days and add a splash of water before reheating.</li>
    </ol>
